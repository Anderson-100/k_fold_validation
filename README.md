# k_fold_validation
Running k-fold validation on an ML model to determine best hyperparameters for gradient descent.

Model is trained on a genetic dataset with 7000+ features and 72 datapoints. These are used to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.

In addition, a regularizer was used due to the large amount of features to try to focus on a smaller set of genes/features.
